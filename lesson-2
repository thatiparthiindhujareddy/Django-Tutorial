This lesson contains a basic Django project that demonstrates how to display "Hello, World!" on the screen using Django's views.py. The text is rendered in an <h1> HTML tag, providing a simple introduction to handling views and templates in Django.

step by step procedure:-
Set Up Your Django Project:
Open your terminal (command prompt) and navigate to the directory where you want to create your Django project.
Run the following command to create a new Django project:
command
django-admin startproject project_name 
Navigate into your project directory
Create a new Django app within the project:
command
python manage.py startapp app_name


Create a View in views.py:
Open myapp/views.py in your code editor.
Define a function that returns an HTML response with "Hello, World!" in an <h1>

Map the View to a URL
Open myproject/urls.py in your code editor.
Import the hello_world view from myapp.views.

Run the Development Server
Back in your terminal, start the Django development server:
command
python manage.py runserver
Open your web browser and go to http://127.0.0.1:8000/.

You should see "Hello, World!" displayed in large text on the screen.
